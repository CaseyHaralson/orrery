      The README needs to describe install-skills, orchestrate, and status
      accurately for end users. Confirm exact flags, aliases, and descriptions
      from the CLI code and existing documentation before writing copy.
    requirements:
      - Review CLI command definitions for install-skills, orchestrate, and
        status
      - Note important flags and aliases to mention in README
      - Identify relevant existing docs to link (if any)
    criteria:
      - Commands, flags, and aliases are documented in notes for the README
      - Any relevant doc link targets are identified

      The README should target end users. Focus on what orrery is, how skills
      interact with orchestration, and how to run the core commands. Keep the
      document concise and avoid contributor/development sections.
    requirements:
      - Add overview describing orrery and how skills are used during
        orchestration
      - Include npm global install instructions
      - Provide quickstart usage examples
      - Document install-skills, orchestrate, and status with key flags
      - Link to relevant docs when helpful
    criteria:
      - README includes overview, install, quickstart, and command reference
      - Skills interaction is explained clearly without deep orrery-* detail
      - Commands and flags match CLI definitions
    files:
      - README.md
    context_files:
      - lib/cli/commands/install-skills.js

      - Ensure command examples are coherent and minimal
      - Remove any contributor/development references
