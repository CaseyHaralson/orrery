    status: "complete"
    deps: []
    parallel: true
    context: |
      The project currently lacks contribution guidelines. New contributors need
      to understand how to set up the development environment, run tests, submit
      PRs, and follow project conventions.

      This should be welcoming but also set clear expectations about code quality
      and the PR review process.

      Note: When writing about CI checks, use future tense ("will be checked")
      since the CI workflow is created in a later step. The linting/formatting
      setup (steps 3.x) and CI workflow (step 4.1) come after this documentation.
    requirements:
      - Create CONTRIBUTING.md in the repository root
      - Include development setup instructions (clone, npm install)
      - Document how to run tests (npm test)
      - Explain the PR process and what reviewers look for
      - Describe commit message conventions (conventional commits style
        preferred)
      - Reference the code of conduct
      - Mention that linting/formatting will be checked in CI
    criteria:
      - CONTRIBUTING.md exists in repository root
      - Document covers setup, testing, and PR process

      Users need to understand what changed between versions. The Keep a Changelog
      format (https://keepachangelog.com/) is the standard.

      Since the project is at version 0.5.0, we should document this as the
      starting point and note that previous versions did not maintain a changelog.
    requirements:
      - Create CHANGELOG.md in repository root
      - Follow Keep a Changelog format (https://keepachangelog.com/)
      - Include [Unreleased] section at top for ongoing changes
      - Add [0.5.0] section with high-level summary of current state

  # Feature 3: Code Quality Tooling (ESLint + Prettier)
  # ============================================================================

    status: "complete"
    deps: []
    parallel: false
    context: |
      ESLint catches code quality issues and enforces consistent patterns.
      The project uses CommonJS and Node.js 18+.

      Use a minimal, sensible configuration that doesn't require major code changes.
      The eslint:recommended ruleset plus node-specific rules is appropriate.

      The project has this structure:
      - lib/ - Core library code
      - bin/ - CLI entry point (orrery.js)
      - test/ - Tests using node --test
    requirements:
      - Install eslint as a devDependency
      - Create eslint.config.js (flat config format, ESLint 9+ style)
      - Configure for Node.js/CommonJS environment
      - Use eslint:recommended as base
      - Add node-specific globals (process, __dirname, etc.)
      - Ignore node_modules, .agent-work, coverage, dist directories
      - "Add 'lint' script to package.json: eslint ."
    criteria:
      - eslint is in devDependencies
      - eslint.config.js exists with proper configuration
      - npm run lint executes without configuration errors
      - Linting covers lib/, bin/, test/ directories
    files:
      - eslint.config.js
      - package.json
    context_files:
      - package.json
      - lib/
      - bin/
    commands:
      - npm install --save-dev eslint
      - npm run lint
    risk_notes: |
      ESLint 9+ uses flat config format which differs from older .eslintrc style.
      Ensure using eslint.config.js (not .eslintrc.json). May report many issues
      in existing code that will be fixed in step 3.4. If npm run lint fails
      initially due to lint errors in the code, that is expected - config errors
      (like "Cannot find module") indicate a setup problem.

      Prettier ensures consistent code formatting. It should be configured to
      work alongside ESLint without conflicts.

      This step depends on 3.1 because both modify package.json - running them
      sequentially avoids merge conflicts in the scripts section.
    requirements:
      - Install prettier as a devDependency
      - Create .prettierrc with sensible defaults (2 space indent, no trailing
        commas, etc.)
      - Create .prettierignore to skip node_modules, .agent-work, coverage, dist
      - "Add 'format' script to package.json: prettier --write ."
      - "Add 'format:check' script for CI: prettier --check ."
    criteria:
      - prettier is in devDependencies
      - .prettierrc exists with configuration
      - .prettierignore exists

      - .prettierignore
      - package.json
    commands:
      - npm install --save-dev prettier
      - npm run format:check
    risk_notes: |
      Prettier may reformat all files on first run. This is expected and will be
      committed as part of step 3.4. Do not commit formatting changes in this step.

      ESLint and Prettier can conflict on formatting rules. The standard solution
      is to use eslint-config-prettier to disable ESLint rules that conflict with
      Prettier.
    requirements:
      - Install eslint-config-prettier as a devDependency
      - Update eslint.config.js to include prettier config (disables conflicting
        rules)
      - Verify linting and formatting work together without conflicts
    criteria:
      - eslint-config-prettier is in devDependencies
      - eslint.config.js includes prettier configuration

    commands:
      - npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
      - npm run format && npm run lint

      After adding linting, there may be existing issues in the codebase.
      Fix these so the project starts with a clean slate.

      Focus on auto-fixable issues first, then manually address any remaining
      problems. Avoid changing code behavior - only fix style/lint issues.
    requirements:
      - Run npm run lint to identify issues
      - Run npm run format to fix formatting issues
      - Manually fix any lint errors that can't be auto-fixed
      - Ensure all tests still pass after fixes

      - npm run lint passes with no errors
      - npm run format:check passes (no unformatted files)
      - npm test passes (no regressions)

    risk_notes: |
      This step may produce a large diff if the codebase has not been formatted
      before. Review changes carefully - formatting should not alter behavior, but
      verify tests pass. If lint --fix introduces unexpected changes, review
      each rule violation manually.

      Raw changelog entries accumulate in [Unreleased] during development.
      At release time, maintainer runs `npm run release:prepare` in a Claude Code
      session. The script analyzes entries and suggests a version type, then the
      agent completes the release preparation.

      This creates a streamlined workflow:
      1. Development: mechanical entries added by agents/contributors
      2. Release: maintainer runs one command, agent handles the rest (except publish)

      No gh CLI or GitHub tokens required - the agent outputs a link and formatted
      release notes for the maintainer to copy-paste into GitHub's release UI.
    requirements:
      - Create scripts/prepare-release.js that:
          - Reads CHANGELOG.md and extracts [Unreleased] section content
          - Exits with message if [Unreleased] is empty or has no entries
          - Analyzes entries to suggest version type (Added/Changed→minor,
            Fixed→patch, anything marked BREAKING→major)
          - Reads repository URL from package.json
          - Outputs the raw entries and suggested version type
          - Outputs instructions for the agent to complete the release
      - Add 'release:prepare' script to package.json that runs the script
      - Document in CLAUDE.md the agent's release workflow steps:
          - Confirm or adjust the suggested version type
          - Summarize raw entries into polished release notes
          - Update CHANGELOG.md (replace [Unreleased] with [x.y.z] - date, add
            empty [Unreleased] section at top)
          - Run npm version <type> (bumps package.json, creates git tag)

      The version suggestion is heuristic based on changelog categories. Agent
      should verify the suggestion makes sense (e.g., a "Fixed" entry that changes
      behavior might warrant minor, not patch). Maintainer has final say before
      npm publish.

      Contributors should understand how releases work, even if they're not
      doing releases themselves. Maintainers need a clear checklist.

      This documents the streamlined release workflow where maintainer runs
      one command and the agent handles preparation.
    requirements:
      - Add "Release Process" section to CONTRIBUTING.md
      - "Document contributor expectations: add brief entries to [Unreleased]
        after user-facing changes"
      - "Document maintainer workflow: 1. Open Claude Code in the repository 2.
        Run npm run release:prepare 3. Agent analyzes, summarizes, updates
        changelog, bumps version, pushes 4. Agent outputs GitHub release link
        and formatted notes 5. Maintainer creates GitHub release (click link,
        paste notes) 6. Maintainer runs npm publish"
      - Mention that only maintainers can publish to npm
      - Note that no gh CLI or tokens are required
    criteria:
      - CONTRIBUTING.md has a "Release Process" section
      - Documents contributor changelog expectations
      - Documents maintainer workflow with numbered steps
      - Mentions the agent-assisted workflow
      - Explains that GitHub release is created manually via link
