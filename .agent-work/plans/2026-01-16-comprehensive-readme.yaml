    status: "complete"
    deps: []
    parallel: false
    context: |
      Create the initial README.md with a high-level overview.
      - Title: Orrery
      - Tagline: Agent Skill Management & Workflow Orchestration
      - Description: Explain that it's a tool to turn high-level goals into executable plans using AI agents.
      - Installation: `npm install -g .` (or local usage via `./bin/orrery.js`)
      - Prerequisites: Node.js, Git, access to LLM agents (Claude/Gemini)
    requirements:
      - Clear value proposition
      - Step-by-step installation instructions
    criteria:
      - README.md exists
      - Introduction clearly explains what Orrery is

  # ============================================================================
  # Feature 2: Core Concepts & Architecture
  # ============================================================================
  - id: "2.1"
    description: "Document Core Concepts (Skills, Plans, Orchestration)"
    status: "pending"
    deps:
      - "1.1"
    parallel: false
    context: |
      Explain the three pillars of the system:
      1. Skills: Specialized capabilities (Discovery, Execute, Verify)
      2. Plans: YAML files defining steps and dependencies
      3. Orchestrator: The engine that executes plans using agents
    requirements:
      - Define 'Skill' (referencing agent/skills/)
      - Define 'Plan' (referencing schemas/plan-schema.yaml)
      - Define 'Orchestrator' (referencing lib/orchestration/)
    criteria:
      - Conceptual overview is accurate to the codebase

    deps:
      - "2.1"
    parallel: false
    context: |
      Write a "Getting Started" or "Usage" section that walks through the lifecycle:
      1. Discovery: User has an idea -> Agent creates Plan YAML
      2. Validation: `orrery validate-plan`
      3. Execution: `orrery orchestrate` (explain branching model)
      4. Completion: PR creation and plan archiving
    requirements:
      - Explain the Discovery phase
      - Explain how the Orchestrator manages git branches (source -> work -> PR)
      - Explain the resume capability
    criteria:
      - Workflow steps match the logic in lib/orchestration/index.js
