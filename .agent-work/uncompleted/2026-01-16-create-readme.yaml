      The project currently lacks a comprehensive README. This step creates one
      that covers the tool's purpose (Agent Skill Orchestration), installation,
      standard workflow, and CLI command reference.
    requirements:
      - "Title: Orrery"
      - "Description: Agent skill management and workflow orchestration"
      - "Installation section (npm install -g .)"
      - "Workflow section: Explain Discovery -> Plan -> Orchestrate loop"
      - "Commands section: Document orchestrate, validate-plan, install-skills, install-devcontainer, status"
      - "Project Structure section: Explain .agent-work directory"
    criteria:
      - "File README.md exists in root"
      - "Contains all required sections"
      - "Command documentation is accurate based on source code"
    files:
      - "README.md"
    context_files:
      - "package.json"
      - "lib/cli/commands/orchestrate.js"
      - "lib/cli/commands/validate-plan.js"
      - "lib/cli/commands/install-skills.js"
      - "lib/cli/commands/status.js"
