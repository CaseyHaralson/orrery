- clean up workflow.md file, shouldn't be needed
- need to remove source_branch and work_branch from plan before trying to rerun
	- and change agent config back to correct order
- 
	
done
- failover to next agent didn't work
- the yaml thing removes comments and does other formatting
	- can it not do that?
