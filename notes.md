- clean up workflow.md file and other unused files
- make sure readme looks good
- rename orchestrate command to "work" or "do-work"
- 
- executing plan agents don't have access to the web, so can't do research...
- have an option to add a .devcontainer to the project
- make .devcontainer use shared volumes
- get gemini working in devcontainer
- 

test
- make plan creation use same yaml project as post hook so plan doesn't change much during processing


done
- failover to next agent didn't work
- the yaml thing removes comments and does other formatting
	- can it not do that?
- need to remove source_branch and work_branch from plan before trying to rerun
	- and change agent config back to correct order
