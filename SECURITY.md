# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep Orrery and its users safe. We appreciate responsible
disclosure of security issues.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published version of Orrery receives security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately so we can coordinate a fix.

- Preferred: Open a private security advisory on GitHub:
  https://github.com/caseyharalson/orrery/security/advisories/new

If you cannot use GitHub advisories, you may open a private issue and request
that it be converted into a security advisory.

## Response Expectations

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a status update
within 7 business days. Fix timelines will vary based on severity and complexity.

## Thanks

Thank you for helping protect the project and the community by reporting
vulnerabilities responsibly.
