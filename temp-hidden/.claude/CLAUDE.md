This repo uses the canonical 5-phase workflow protocol that all coding AI agents must follow when working on tasks: **Intake → Plan → Execute → Verify → Report**.

All agents, regardless of which AI tool powers them, follow this unified workflow. This ensures consistency, enables agent-to-agent handoff, and provides clear checkpoints for quality control.

Each step in the workflow has an associated agent skill that must be used during that step.

IMPORTANT: IF THE USER IS ASKING FOR WORK TO BE DONE, USE THE INTAKE AGENT SKILL.
