- delete the work/reports folder as last stage before PR
	- actually delete everything except for "plans" folder and "completed" folder
	- make a cleanup step?
- change status to report on plans that have a work branch as "in flight" or something?
- 
- change simulate-plan to specifically require a .agent-work plan file
- readme: actually, sometimes you do want to drop a plan off...
	- maybe add a section to manually drop a plan off and then run validation against it
	- or maybe drop a plan off and run orrery against it to injest it into the correct place?
- 


testing
- need to create temp smaller plans in the orchestrator so agents only read the parts of the plan that are needed
